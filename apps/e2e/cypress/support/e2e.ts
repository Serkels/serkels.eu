    // Next.js often performs server-side redirects for various reasons, such as:
    // - Authentication flows (redirecting to login page if not authenticated)
    // - Conditional rendering based on user data
    // - Route changes based on server-side logic
    // When these redirects occur, they can throw a "NEXT_REDIRECT" error,
    // which is expected behavior and should not cause the test to fail.
    // Returning false here prevents Cypress from failing the test when such an error is encountered.
